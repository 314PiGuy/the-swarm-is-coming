# XRP Swarm

XRPs are small robots that can be utilized in educational purposes. They are relatively cheap to purchase and easy to assemble. 
This program aims to utilize bluetooth connection to create a Piconet between XRPs to allow control of a large amount of robots in one application. This could be further iterated upon to allow for aplications such as algorithmic control such as in advanced swarm robotics.

# Quick Start Demo

1. Download swarm.py and example.py.
2. Upload both files to an XRP using https://xrpcode.wpi.edu/
3. Run example.py
4. Repeat for each XRP, modifying the ID and if the XRP can have children
